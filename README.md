Hi, Webbylab team! I am really grateful for such a good task!

I managed to implement all the requierements of the task.

How to run this app?

1. `git clone https://github.com/Paul-Vasylenko/webbylab-test.git`
2. Create `.env` file which will be the same as `.env.example`. Please don't change the port.
3. Run command `docker run --name movies -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env paul1408/movies`
4. Success! Now you can send requests to `localhost:5000`

If something goes wrong contact me in telegram @Paul_1408
